Collaboration hub for the Fifth Suggestions Directory: (https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/451103/)

Note: I have not used Github, ever. Please correct me if I did something incorrectly or strangely, as I haven't a clue what I'm doing.

So, you would like to contribute to the 5th Suggestions Directory! That's amazing, but first we need to go over some things.
Consult the Sample Topics spreadsheet. That contains 200 topics I've written descriptions for (but not add keywords or tags for), so please skim through that to get a feel for
what I'm looking for when you write a description. Note these stylistic things I adhere to and would like you to as well:

If a topic's last post was over two years ago and the suggestion isn't relevant or not very good, please ignore and it write "too little discussion" in the description box.

If the topic is stil relevant or quite decent, please bump it and write a description as you would normally.

If the topic's title is long, verbose, and you can't write a description for it without basically rewording the title, write "Ad pedem litterae" (Latin for "exactly as it is written").

If the topic goes to a 403, the topic was probably merged with another topic. Please write "merged".

If you feel that there is almost certainly that topic is a duplicate, write "merge" or "duplicate". If the duplicate is not in the spreadsheet, we'll find it afterwards.

If the topic is obviously rejected, report it as such and write "rejected".

If you encounter a sticky or iTopic, write "this one's next" as it's funny and might be true, teehee.

When writing a description, you can do whatever you think is necessary. Keep it brief; one sentence is good enough. Try not to explain the reasoning behind a suggestion, just what
it is and what it does. You can stick to my templates of "the ability to", "add a block", or "allow" which is recommended but definitely not needed.

And keep in mind that no contribution is too small! You can do three topics a day, or three hundred! Just keep in mind that this is for the good of everyone that uses the Suggestions forum.
That's all I have to say for now. Happy contributing!
